# About Me (OranotseG)
Personal GitHub profile showcasing my journey as an IT graduate and AWS re/Start learner, with a focus on AWS, cloud computing, and future cloud security work.

## Hi, I’m Oranotse 👋

🎓 IT (Software Development) Graduate  
☁️ AWS re/Start Learner  
📍 South Africa  

### About Me
I am an IT graduate with a background in software development and a growing interest in cloud computing. I am currently part of the AWS re/Start programme, where I am building a strong foundation in AWS, networking, and cloud concepts through hands-on labs and practical exercises.

I am especially interested in how cloud technologies intersect with security, and my long-term goal is to move into cloud security. For now, I am focused on developing solid fundamentals and positioning myself for entry-level roles such as Cloud Practitioner or Junior Cloud Engineer.

### What I’m Currently Learning 🌱
- AWS core services (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC)
- Cloud fundamentals and architecture
- Networking basics for cloud environments
- Linux and command-line fundamentals
- Security concepts in the cloud

### What I’m Working Towards 🚀
I am intentionally building practical skills through labs and small projects while learning how real-world cloud environments operate. My aim is to grow into a professional who understands both infrastructure and security, rather than rushing into advanced topics without strong foundations.

### Interests 🔐☁️
